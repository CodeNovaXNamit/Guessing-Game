Guess the Number - Python Project


Brief description:-
TThis program is a "Guess the Number" game. In this game, the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it.

Question: Why did you make it?
Answer: I made this project as a milestone in my Python journey. It makes me happy that I created something myself. You can make this too — and of course, I’d love to see others build it as well!

🎮 How to Play: Just enter your guess, and the game will tell you if it's too high or too low.
If it's "high," your guess is more than the secret number.
If it's "low," your guess is less than the secret number.
